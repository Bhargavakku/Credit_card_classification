# Credit_card_classification
In today’s era, credit cards have become one of the most preferred modes of payment for everyday expenses such as dining, entertainment, and shopping. They eliminate the need to carry cash, lower the risk of theft, and provide users with a seamless payment experience. The global credit card payments industry, valued at around USD 138.43 billion in 2020, is expected to almost double to USD 263.47 billion by 2028, with a projected CAGR of 8.5% between 2021 and 2028. In India, the adoption of digital payments has grown rapidly. A Mastercard survey in 2020 revealed that 42% of Indians reported an increase in their use of digital payment solutions, including contactless credit cards and online transactions—further driving market expansion. However, despite their profitability, credit cards pose challenges for banks, especially smaller institutions and NBFCs, where issues such as customer attrition and payment defaults remain pressing concerns. In this project, classification models are tried so that a small financal institute which is just starting it's operations in the lending business can predict churners and defaulters to tackle them efficiently. And right now in India ,there is a bubble of credit cards or credit has a whole credit system and it is important for a financial institute to be cautious about defaults while earning more keeping as much customers as possible.
